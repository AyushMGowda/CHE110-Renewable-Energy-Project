  <p>
    Geothermal energy is a renewable resource that harnesses the Earth’s internal
    heat to generate electricity and provide heating and cooling. By drilling
    wells into underground reservoirs of hot water and steam, geothermal power
    plants convert natural thermal energy into reliable electrical power.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of geothermal energy’s greatest strengths is its constant availability.
    Unlike solar or wind energy, geothermal systems operate continuously,
    providing stable baseload electricity that supports modern energy demands.

  <p>
    Geothermal power has a very low environmental impact. It produces minimal
    greenhouse gas emissions, requires relatively small land areas, and often
    reinjects used water back into the Earth to maintain sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond electricity generation, geothermal energy is widely used for direct
    heating in homes, agriculture, and industrial processes. Geothermal heat
    pumps provide efficient heating and cooling by using the Earth’s stable
    underground temperature.
  </p>

  <p>
    As exploration and technology improve worldwide, geothermal energy is
    expected to play a growing role in the global transition toward clean,
    carbon-neutral power systems.
