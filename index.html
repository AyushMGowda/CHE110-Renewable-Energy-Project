            <br><p>Renewable energy is energy from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale.
   Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat.
    Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not. For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation.
   Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling. Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development.</p>
<img src="images\Text 2.png" alt="" style="float: center;" width="100%">
   <p>Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can move heat or objects efficiently, and is clean at the point of consumption.
   From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy grew from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply. Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%, and nuclear from 12% to 10%. The share of hydropower decreased from 16% to 15% while power from sun and wind increased from 2% to 10%.
    Biomass and geothermal energy grew from 2% to 3%. There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector.
   In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity.</p>
<p>Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries.
   Deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits.
    However renewables are being hindered by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies. In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for renewables such as solar power and wind power.
     In 2022 the International Energy Agency asked countries to solve policy, regulatory, permitting and financing obstacles to adding more renewables, to have a better chance of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>

      <h1 style=" color: aqua; background-color: rgb(60, 60, 60);">Benefits of Renewable Energy</h1>
      <div style="margin: 15%;"></div>
      <img src="images\download.png" alt="Benefits" width="800" height="500" style="border-radius: 50%;">
      <p style="margin: 10%;">Renewable energy offers a multitude of benefits that span environmental, economic, and social dimensions, making it a crucial component of a sustainable future. One of the primary advantages is the positive environmental impact. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power generate electricity with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. This reduction in carbon dioxide and other pollutants helps mitigate climate change, decrease air and water pollution, and preserve ecosystems.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10%;">Economically, the renewable energy sector fosters job creation and economic growth. As the industry expands, there is a growing demand for skilled workers in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and research and development. Additionally, investing in renewable energy can contribute to energy independence by diversifying the energy supply, reducing reliance on imported fuels, and stabilizing energy prices. The long-term economic viability of renewable energy is further enhanced by the decreasing costs associated with technology advancements and economies of scale.</p>
      <img src="images\Text 3.png" style="float: center;" width="75%" >
      <p style="margin: 10%;">Another noteworthy benefit is the enhancement of energy security. Unlike finite fossil fuel reserves, renewable resources are abundant and widely distributed, reducing geopolitical tensions related to energy resources. This decentralization of energy production also makes the grid more resilient to disruptions, such as natural disasters or cyber-attacks.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10%;">Renewable energy projects often have positive social impacts as well. They can bring about community development by providing opportunities for local job creation and infrastructure development. Furthermore, decentralized renewable systems, like solar panels on residential rooftops, empower individuals to become energy producers, fostering a sense of energy autonomy and self-sufficiency. Access to renewable energy can also address energy poverty, bringing electricity to remote and underserved regions where traditional grid access is challenging.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10%;">In terms of health, the transition to renewable energy can significantly improve air and water quality. The combustion of fossil fuels releases pollutants that have adverse effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health. By replacing these sources with clean and sustainable alternatives, we can reduce the prevalence of air and waterborne diseases.</p>
      <p style="margin: 10%;">As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, dwindling fossil fuel reserves, and the need for sustainable development, the benefits of renewable energy become increasingly apparent. The transition to renewable energy is not just an ecological imperative; it is a pathway to a more equitable, resilient, and prosperous future for communities and nations alike.</p>
