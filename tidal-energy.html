  <p>
    Tidal energy harnesses the gravitational interaction between the Earth,
    moon, and sun to generate electricity from the predictable rise and fall of
    ocean tides. This emerging renewable technology offers a sustainable and
    reliable alternative to fossil-fuel-based power generation.
  </p>

  <p>
    One primary method uses underwater tidal stream turbines placed in regions
    with strong currents. As tides move in and out, turbine blades rotate and
    convert kinetic energy into electricity. Tidal range systems, such as tidal
    lagoons and barrages, generate power from differences in water levels between
    high and low tides.
  </p>

  <p>
    A defining advantage of tidal energy is predictability. Because tidal cycles
    follow precise natural patterns, electricity production can be forecast with
    high accuracy, improving grid stability and long-term energy planning.

  <p>
    Environmental impacts are relatively low. Tidal systems produce no direct
    greenhouse gas emissions, create minimal noise or visual pollution, and may
    even support marine ecosystems by forming artificial reef habitats.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although still developing compared to solar or wind, advances in marine
    engineering and cost reduction are steadily improving tidal energy’s
    feasibility. In the future, it has strong potential to become an important
    contributor to the global renewable energy mix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, tidal energy represents a promising frontier in sustainable power.
    Its predictability, environmental advantages, and long-term scalability make
    it a valuable component of the transition toward a cleaner energy future.
